# DBSCAN
DBSCAN implementation in C++

The clustering made in 2d dimension but can be easily changed to any other dimension you please.

I have an input file of 11 points. If you want to change the input just change in the "Set of Points" file, but be consistent: each coordinate separated with regular spacing and each point in new line. 

The output may be different from time to time because of the unordered set. It doesn't mean it's wrong, as long as the points that need to be under the same cluster are classified with the same cluster ID.
