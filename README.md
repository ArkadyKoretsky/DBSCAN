# DBSCAN
DBSCAN implementation in C++

# Important Notes
1. The clustering made in 2d dimension but can be easily changed to any other dimension you please.
2. The output may be different from time to time because of the unordered set. It doesn't mean it's wrong, as long as the points that need to be under the same cluster are classified with the same cluster ID. 

# How to run it?
1. If you want to insert your own input you can choose to work with the existing file("Set of Points") and insert into the file your own points. But be consistent: each coordinate separated with regular spacing and each point in new line. 
2. The maximum distance and the minimum amount of points are the arguments in the main.
3. You can choose the option to generate random points and change their range and the amount.
